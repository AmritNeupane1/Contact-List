# Contact-List

PROJECT OVERVIEW
Contact List using Doubly Linked Lists Data Structure supports searching and sorting
using just a few characters of the search criteria. You can search by phone number
,name and gmail . Search results can return one or multiple items and the list comes
back in sorted order. You can also update or delete contact numbers from the Contact
list.

Implemented data structures
1.Array
2.Doubly Linked List

Phone directory have three main operations:
1.Searching
2.Sorting
3.Deleting
These three operations can be performed efficiently(among above data structures)
with Linked List. Doubly Linked List is used while searching the first element but the
current status of the pointer is in between middle and first element so it should
traverse backward because then it will take less time.We also used classes to define
nodes and contact list. Inside contact list we used these function.
